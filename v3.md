TODO:

 * Work on hidden inputs
 * Write up a theme
 * Show why this is a good thing - file button on left and select width
 * Detect/set widths via CSS, not JS
 * Sprite constructor
 * Web based sprite constructor?
 * Select lists need to be REALLY easy to auto size and to fix the size
 * Repeating middles for nicely expanding buttons/select lists
 * Consider placeholder
 * Consider styling textareas
 * Hide content from screen readers with visibility:hidden or HTML tag attribute aria-hidden="true"
 * Disabled and elements get aria-disabled="true" and aria-readonly="true"
 * Checked = aria-checked="true", aria-pressed="true" ??  http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties
 * Copy the 'id' but prefix it with uniformjs

Version 3 goal:

 * Simplification of how Uniform does its job
 * Bug fixes, especially with cross browser compatibility or obscure edge cases
 * Doing things right automatically - `$('body').uniform()` should get you started nicely

Version 3 changes:

 * Removal of most options and instead attempt to standardize configuration
 * Standardize how things are wrapped
 * Implement polling so UI elements are automatically updated
 * Split theme images up
 * Let software generate CSS and assemble sprites as needed
 * Changing to more of a flags-based approach with uniform classes
 * Allow more flexibility with themes as you detect element states with whatever CSS you would like
 * Profiling the CPU usage to ensure a high quality experience
 * Removal of jQuery for many internal operations for faster performance
 * Classes are propagated to the wrapper and are watched for changes
 * Permit several new styling possibilities, like right-handed buttons for file uploads and a more natural way to set widths

Version 3 options:

    fileButtonHtml: "Browse"
    fileDefaultHtml: "No file selected"

Classes applied by element status to the wrapper div (the one with the `uniformjs` class):

 * .default - Using a default value for submit/reset buttons or the default text for a file upload with no file selected.
 * .disabled - Element has the `disabled` attribute or property set.
 * .focus - User has most recently used the element or has tabbed over to it.  Automatically updated through events.
 * .hidden - Element is not visible.

 * .indeterminate - Checkbox or radio is in an indeterminate state (special HTML attribute)
 * .readonly - Element has the `readonly` attribute or property
 * .required - Element has the `required` attribute or property

In addition to these, all classes from the wrapped element are also copied up to the wrapper.
